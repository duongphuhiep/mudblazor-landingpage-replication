# App template

This is the template for the main [app](../app/).

It is usually developed (and so maintained) by a Web Designer, then port to the main [Blazor's app](../app/).

The purpose is to experiment different designs / CSS, animation.

Some experiments might not be ported to the main app.

The [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) with excelence components support & hot loading support is used for this purpose.

# How to run the template

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
